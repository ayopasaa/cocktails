The complete book, from the collection of the San Francisco Public Library.

I waive any copyright claim I may have in this image and dedicate my copyright interest in the image to the public domain. I also believe that the book depicted in the image is in the public domain, though I do not warrant that it is. The book was published between 1923 and 1963, so the author was required to renew the copyright 28 years after publication to prevent it from entering into the public domain. My search of the copyright renewals database (http://collections.stanford.edu/copyrightrenewals/) indicates that the copyright in this book was not renewed.
