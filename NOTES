use gimp python scripts

use OpenCV to further process the images
We wanted to slice the image but openCV may be able to do it more
intelligently. 

we could do things like train a ML algo on what's likely a cocktail name and
what's likes an ingredient. 

Got to figure out how to preserve portions. Maybe it could preserve areas of
the image it has low confidence on and ask someone what it says, like
reCAPTCHA.
